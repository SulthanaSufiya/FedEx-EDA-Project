## 📈 Project Summary

This EDA project analyzes the global delivery performance of **FedEx Logistics**, focusing on uncovering insights into:

- Delivery delays  
- Vendor reliability  
- Shipment mode efficiency  
- Regional shipping performance  
- Cost and risk correlations (e.g., weight vs. insurance)

The dataset includes key details on:
- Purchase orders
- Scheduled vs. actual deliveries
- Shipment modes
- Managing teams
- Vendor terms

## 💼 Problem Statement

To analyze shipment and delivery performance data to identify **factors leading to delivery delays** and provide **data-driven recommendations** for improving on-time performance across regions, vendors, and shipment types.

---

## 🎯 Business Objectives

- 📊 Monitor vendor performance
- ✈️ Optimize shipment mode selection
- 🔔 Predict high-risk delivery delays
- 💰 Support cost-effective and timely delivery decisions

---

## ✅ Solution Highlights

- ✅ Created delivery status labels: **On Time** or **Delayed**
- ✅ Built delay metrics: `Delivery Delay (Days)`
- ✅ Designed **visual insights** using `Seaborn`, `Matplotlib`, and `Plotly`
- ✅ Generated **correlation heatmaps** to understand patterns
- ✅ Compared performance across `Country`, `Managed By`, `Shipment Mode`, and `Vendor INCO Terms`
